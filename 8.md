**Task 8: Git Version Control (Days 22-24)**

Day 22-24: Git Version Control

## Deadline in 3 days

Goal: Master version control and collaboration

## Task 1: Learn Git basics

#### Focus on: Initializing a repository (`git init`), staging changes (`git add`), committing changes (`git commit`), checking status (`git status`), viewing history (`git log`).

## Task 2: Understand branching and merging

#### Focus on: Creating branches (`git branch`, `git checkout -b`), switching branches (`git checkout`), merging branches (`git merge`), resolving merge conflicts.

## Task 3: Practice with GitHub/GitLab (or other remote repository service)

#### Focus on: Cloning remote repositories (`git clone`), pushing changes (`git push`), pulling changes (`git pull`), creating pull/merge requests.

## Task 4: Set up repositories for your projects

#### Focus on: Creating a Git repository for the website project built so far and practicing the workflow of committing changes and pushing to a remote.
