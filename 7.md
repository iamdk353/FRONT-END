**Task 7: ES6+ Modern JavaScript (Days 19-21)**

Day 19-21: ES6+ Modern JavaScript

## Deadline in 2 days

# Goal: Learn modern JavaScript features and best practices

## Task 1: Arrow functions, template literals, destructuring

Focus on: Syntax and benefits of arrow functions (lexical `this`); creating strings with template literals; destructuring assignments for arrays and objects.

## Task 2: Promises, async/await, and fetch API

Focus on: Understanding asynchronous JavaScript; handling async operations with Promises (`.then()`, `.catch()`, `.finally()`); simplifying async code with `async/await`; making HTTP requests with `Workspace`.

## Task 3: Modules (import/export)

Focus on: Organizing code into reusable modules; `export` (named and default) and `import` syntax.

## Task 4: Let/const, spread operator, and array methods

Focus on: Reinforcing `let`/`const` usage; using spread (`...`) for arrays/objects; useful ES6+ array methods like `find`, `findIndex`, `includes`, `forEach`.
