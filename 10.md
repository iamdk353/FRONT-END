**Task 10: React Hooks & State Management (Days 31-33)**

Day 31-33: React Hooks & State Management

## Deadline in 3 days

Goal: Master React hooks and complex state handling

## Task 1: Learn `useEffect` hook

#### Focus on: Performing side effects in functional components (data fetching, subscriptions, manually changing the DOM), understanding the dependency array.

## Task 2: Learn `useContext` hook

#### Focus on: Sharing state across the component tree without prop drilling.

## Task 3: Learn `useReducer` hook

#### Focus on: Managing more complex component state logic, an alternative to `useState` for state involving multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.

## Task 4: Practice with custom hooks

#### Focus on: Creating your own reusable hooks to encapsulate component logic.
