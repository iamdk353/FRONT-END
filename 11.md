## Deadline in 3 days

Goal: Connect frontend to backend services

## Task 2: Master `Workspace` API and/or `axios`

#### Focus on: Making GET requests to fetch data, POST requests to send data, handling responses (JSON), and error handling.

## Task 3: Handle async operations and loading states

#### Focus on: Managing loading UI indicators while data is being fetched, displaying error messages if requests fail, using `async/await` with API calls.
